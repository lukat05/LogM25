# LogM25
These are all of the code files I used for the LogM project

Each code block represents some of the things I played around with, and most of which is self explanitory.
The main purpose of my code was to be a playground for exploring ornamentation lattices, and because of 
this there was not much organization in the first place. However, here is a list of what each file was used for:

- Luka_02-18: Used as just a general playground to test and introduce myself to the code in this Sage library
- Ornamentation Lattices Code: just the functions that we defined as a base, given to us by Dr. Andrew Sack
- 'Amy Cho': Code sent to me from a group member (Amy Cho) who wrote some functions that were helpful to use in other playgrounds as well 
as for our understanding of everything
- Unnested Leaf Blower: Removing specific elements from the poset of the join irreducibles of the spine, specifically those with no nested
leaves
- Worksheet1: This is in response to an asignment given to us by Dr. Andrew Sack at the beginning of the year
- Spine Classification: This was used in a lot of exploratory analysis of the spine throughout the project

HOW TO USE THIS CODE:

install Ubuntu on your laptop and use that to set up SageMath, which you can find out how to do by a quick google search. It varies by system,
so make sure you know which OS you have (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.). From there, use the following code inthe Ubuntu terminal:

conda activate sage
jupyter notebook --allow-root

This will give you a link to insert into a browser and fromthere use Jupyter Notebook. Upload these files into this notebook, and then in
order to run them, ensure that you are using a Sage kernel specifically, as a standard Python Kernel will not allow it to run.

Once you have done all of that, have fun with the code!
